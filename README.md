# roll20-fearless
various roll20 macros to support Fearless roll playing system (https://athibaultcad.wixsite.com/spop)

These are based on the Roll20 macros that are available for basic games for which there are no character sheets available for the system (as is the case for Fearless)

First the basic documentation about macros, first the [Dice Reference](https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/360037773133-Dice-Reference)
then armed with this knowledge you can start tackling [Macros](https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/360037256794-Macros) to reach a bit more automation.


here are some samples of macros for known systems
